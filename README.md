this is a much more powerful machine than my laptop and thus a much more powerful config. probably sucks just as much.

- compositor: [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom)
- terminal: [luke smith's build of st](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st) (i would try patching and building it myself but it never works out for me) (subject to change)
  - colour scheme: a slightly modified version of [Base2Tone-iterm2-SuburbDark](https://github.com/atelierbram/Base2Tone-iterm2) (the screenshots are now out of date i'll update them when i think about it)
